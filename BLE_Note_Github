News Review: Trump's tweets branded racist

The story:

A group of Democratic congresswomen criticised by President Trump in a series of racially-charged
tweets have accused him of pursuing a white-nationalist agenda. At a joint news conference, 
the four women - none of them white - condemned what they called the president's 'xenophobic comments'.
One of them, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said that all American citizens had a right to be in the
US - no matter the colour of their skin or their religion.
