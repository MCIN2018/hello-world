[BBC] Anti-natalists: The people who want you to stop having babies.
不想生孩子的人们


They believe humans shouldn't have children.who are the anti-natalists and how far are they willing to push their ideas?
他们认为人类不该生孩子。反生育者到底是何许人也？他们又是如何推广他们的观点的？


"Wouldn't it just be better to blow a hold in the side of the earth and just have done with everything?"
比起其他选项，直接从地球的一端凿个洞，从此地球和人类一起毁灭，是不是更好？
#note: "and just be done with everything, means and just finish (or end) everything" - By Ken



Thomas, 29, lives in the east of England, and although his idea of blowing up the world is something of a thought experiment, he
is certain about one thing - humans should not have babies ,and our species should gradually go extinct. 
住在英格兰东部，29岁的托马斯，尽管他的“把地球凿一个洞”的想法仅能算做一项思想实验，另一件事他却十分确信：人类不应该繁衍后代，我们的种族应该逐渐灭绝。

It's a philosophy called anti-natalism. While the idea dates back to Ancient Greek, it has recently 
been given a huge boost by social media.

这个称为“反生育论”的观点，尽管可以追溯到古希腊时期，但最近却在社交网络上大面积火热起来。

On Facebook and Reddit, there are dozens of anti-natalist groups, some with thousands of members.On Reddit,
 r/antinatalism has nearly  35,000 members, while one of the dozens of Facebook groups with an anti-natalist theme 
has more than 6,000.

Facebook 和Reddit上，都有几十个反生育者小组，有些组员都有几千人。 Reddit上的r/antinatalism, 成员将尽3万5千人。Facebook上的仅仅一个组，成员就超过了6千多人。
这样的组Facebook上有几十个。

They are scattered around the world and have a variety of reasons for theirs beliefs. Among them are concerns about 
genetic inheritance, not wanting children to suffer, the concept of consent, and worries about overpopulation and the environment.
这些小组在世界上传播开来，为他们的观点提供了众多的理由。比如，出于对基因遗传的考虑，不想孩子受苦，出生并没有得到孩子的许可，对人口过剩和环境资源的担心。


But they are united in their desire to stop human procreation. And although they are a fridge movement, some of their views,
 particularly on the state of the earth, are increasingly creeping into the mainstream discussion.

他们因为对人类停止繁殖后代的共同愿望而联合在一起。尽管只是边缘运动，其中的某些观点，尤其是与地球现状相关的观点，正不断渗透入主流价值观的讨论当中。

While not a anti-natalist, the Duke of Sussex recently said he and his wife were planning to have a maximum of two children,
because of environmental concerns.

 Sussex 公爵尽管并不是反生育者，但近期他仍然说，出于对环境问题的考虑，他和妻子决定最多只要两个孩子。

Thomas hadn't heard of anti-natalism before someone used the term to describe his views in a Facebook comments thread 
A few years ago.Since then, he's become an active member of an anti-natalist Facebook group. It provides him with intellectual
Stimulation and a place to test his debating skills.

 Thomas 在别人用反生育者在一个fackbook帖子里描述他之前，并没听说说这个词。从那以后，他就成了一个Facebook小组里的活跃成员。在那里，他可以被激处灵感，
也能锻炼辩论技巧。


=== Insults and criticism.
That doesn't mean that all anti-natalist hate children, according to whose who spoke to BBC.
并非所有都讨厌孩子。从接受BBC采访的人中可见一斑。

“I would say I personally like children and it's because I like them that I don't want them to suffer." Said Nancy. 
"Maybe bringing them into the world would give me some pleasure but the possible threat is so huge I'm just not sure 
it's worth it.

"我挺喜欢孩子，也正是因为我喜欢孩子，才不想要他们受苦。”。 Nancy这样说到。“把他们带到这个世界上也许会给我带来快乐，但他们会面对的潜在威胁太巨大了，
我不确定我那点快乐是不是值得冒这么大的风险。

In some　anti-natalism groups, users allude to the notion that babies shouldn't been born in war zones, if there is high 
Chance of disability, or even to low-income parents. At times the rhetoric sounds like selective bleeding-or eugenics.


在一些反生育组中，组员们暗示战乱地区的人不应该生孩子，如果孩子先天残疾的概率高，甚至父母的收入等情况，也不应该生孩子。有时，这听起来很像一种种族选择，择优出生。

The anti-natalists we spoke to had mixed feelings about those ideas.
我们采访的这些人中，对这些观点的感觉也各异。

"What are their motives behind having a baby?"says Thomas, when asked if he's concerned about children being born in war-torn
Areas." In such a country there is less hope that things are going to turn around."

”在这些地区的人想生孩子的动机是什么呢？“当被问到他对战争区域出生的孩子的观点时，Thomas这样说到。”在这些地区，情况好转的希望很渺茫啊。“

He's more relaxed about children being born into low-income households.
出生在低收入家庭的孩子，他的态度会轻松得多。

"Obviously I am against having kids... but I think you can be happy and in a low-income area."
“很明显我反对生孩子，但我想及时生多在低收入区域，人仍然可以活得快乐。”


“My anti-natalism is across the board," states Nancy.She opposes eugenics. " why are we picking and choosing some groups because 
They are in a position of disadvantage?"

我的反生育理论并没有具体针对的群体。nancy说。 她不赞成种族选择。为什么我们要单独强调某些群体，仅仅因为他们处在不利的条件下呢？

“Do the best you can," says Kirk, "Be kind - and don't procreate."

 “做到极致，与人为善，并且，别把生命带到这个世界上。” Kirk　说。
