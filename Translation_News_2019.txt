The　off Facebook Activity will let you drill down  exactly what data various apps or websites are sharing about you -
 Facebook says the average smartphone user has 80 apps and uses 40 of them every month, so the list could be long.
off Facebook Activity设置会帮你探测出各种正在分享你的信息的应用和网站。非死不可称，平均每个智能手机用户会装80个应用，每月会用到的有40个。因此
这个列表会很长。

You will then be able to disconnect the data from your Facebook profile- either the whole lot or singling out 
individual sources. You take advantage of this, it should mean that those shoe apps stop following you across
 the internet in quite such a persistent fashion.
随后,不论是选择将这些应用和网站全部屏蔽，还是选择其中的某些，你的非死不可账户将和这些数据切断联系。 若论你所获得的益处，可以说，
这些鞋的广告不再以目前这种死缠烂打的方式，跟踪你在网上的行为轨迹了。

It is important to stress that facebook will still collect the data, but it will be anonymized- they may know 
lots of people have been looking at those boots but they won't know that they include you.
需要强调的是，非死不可仍然收集这些数据，只是改用了匿名的方式- 他们可能会知道很多人在查鞋的信息，但不会知道你是其中的一员。

Off-facebook activity has been more than a year in the making and fulfill a pledge made by Mark Zuckerbery 
at last year's F8 developer conference to give users greater control over how their data is used.
去年的F8开发大会上，马克-赞克伯格承诺，对于如果使用这些数据，会给用户提供更多的控制权限。 Off-Facebook Activity就是为了履行这个承诺，
其研发也已经持续了一年多的时间了。

But how will users react to this feature, and what will it mean to facebook's advertising business? I suspect
that those people who do use it will be pretty horrified. 　It is one thing to know that in principle you are
 being tracked, quite another to see it in black and white.
但用户对这项功能做何种反应，以及它对非死不可的广告业务意味着什么？ 我怀疑那些正真使用这项功能的用户会吓一跳的。理论上知道自己被偷窥
是一回事，能理智看待却是另一码事了。

"This is how much of the internet works," says facebook rather defensively in a blog about the new tool
"互联网差不多都是这么做的。”关于这个新功能，非死不可在一篇博客里颇有防御意味地如是说。

And in a briefing Stephanie Max, the product manager behind it, made the unlikely claim that the reason it 
 collect the data was to help users "discover businesses they care about."
在一个功能简介里，　这项功能的产品经理Stephanie Max，发表了一个滑稽的声明，称他们收集这些数据的原因，是为了帮助用户：“发掘他们
关心的商业信息。”

If millions of users do investigate this new setting and then decide to disconnect the data, then that 
in theory could prove the damaging to advertisers and to facebook's line. How much impact would there be, we
asked Stephanie Max, if say 20% of users shut down the link between this stream of data and their profiles?
如果数百万的用户都考查这项新设置，并决定启用它来切断数据连接，理论上可以推测出广告商与非死不可会遭受的损失最大值。 
我们咨询了Stephanie Max，如果20%的用户关闭了数据流与账户之间的连接,损失会有多大呢？

"We didn't do any modeling of that." She replied, going on say there was a lot of evidence that users valued 
 having a personalized experience and that was intertwined with the way facebook works currently.
她回答说：“我们没做过任何相关的评估”。并继续说用户以前都对个性化的体验很受用，这和非死不和目前的工作模式是相辅相成的，
他们有很多证据可以证明这一点。

It would seem bizarre that facebook would not have worked out in advance what impact the new transparency
 might have on its revenues, but the company may be right to be pretty relaxed.
facebook甚至没有事先计算出新的透明化选项会给公司的收入带来多大的影响。这看起来真的很奇怪，但他们选择放轻松也许是十分正确的。

For one thing , it looks likely that finding and then acting on the off-facebook tool will be a very niche activity.
For another, an expert on facebook's advertising business says that it is changing in ways that make the precise 
targeting of users less important.
一方面，开发出并启动这项off-facebook工具的动作，看起来很漂亮。另一方面，一位非死不可的广告业务专业说，他们正在改变方策略，
以便令精准地定位到用户不再那么重要。

A Feature in settings called Off Facebook Activity will show all the apps and websites that send information about you to Facebook- which is then used to target ads more effectively.
在设置里，有一个叫做“off Facebook Activity”的选项。勾选这个选项，会显示出所有把你的信息发送给Fackbook的应用与网站，这些信息会让发送给你的广告更高效。

You will also be able to clear your history and prevent your future off-app behavior being tapped. But an expert said the move was unlikely to have a big impact on the firm's profit.
你也可以清空历史记录，并不再让未来的任何线下行为被跟踪。但一位专家表示，这对这家公司的收益并没什么太大的影响。

For now, it is rolling out very slowly, with only Ireland,South Korea and Spain getting access. But the goal is to eventually offer it globally.
添加这项功能的过程进展得十分缓慢，目前，只在爱尔兰、韩国和西班牙可用。但最终会在全球提供。

The initiative comes at a time when Apple and Mozilla have already taken steps to prevent Facebook and other services tracking users from one platform to another via their browsers.
苹果与谷歌采取措施，阻止非死不可以及其他应用通过它们的浏览器从一个在线平台获得用户信息传递给另一个平台，这是此项功能出现的起因。

In addition, Germany's competition regulator had told the company it needed to substantially restrict the way it collected and combined data about its members unless it sought more explicit consent than it had done.

不论你主动通过facebook登陆了另一个应用，或者，更可能的情况是，你所浏览的网站用了某个叫做Facebook Pixel的插件来跟踪你的行动，Facebook 都可以跨越它自己的平台收集到数据。

[BBC] North Korea snubs peace talk with South Korea over war drills
韩国发起战争演习，朝鲜拒绝与韩国和平谈判。

North Korea has rejected any further talks with South Korea, blaming its joint military exercise with the US.
朝鲜谴责韩国与美国合作发起的联合军事演习，拒绝与韩国进行任何后续谈判


This country's reunification committee issued a statement in response to the speech by South Korea president Moon Jae-in on Thursday
这个国家的统一委员会发表了一项声明，来回应本周四韩国总统卢武铉的演讲。

Early on Friday, North Korea test-fired two missiles into the sea of its  eastern coast, the South Korea military said.
韩国军方说，朝鲜在周五早早在其东海岸实验发射了两枚导弹。

In a speech, making Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, President Moon vowed to unite the Korea peninsula by 2045.

Korea divided into two countries at the end of the world War Two.

President Moon said the goal of achieving denuclearization on the Korean peninsular was at its "most critical junction", as talks between North and South appear deadlocked.
卢武铉总统说，实现朝鲜半岛无核化的目标是其中最重要的环节。而南北朝鲜的对话也进入了僵局。

"A new Korean Peninsula, one that will bring peace and prosperity to itself , to Asia and the world, awits us," he said in a televised speech.
"一个全新的朝鲜半岛，一个会为其自身，为亚洲，以及整个世界带来和平和繁荣的朝鲜半岛，正在等待着我们。“ 他在一个演进录影中这样说。

# What has the reaction been?
	朝鲜作何反应?

In a statement, the North questioned the meaning of dialogue " when the joint military exercises against us in South Korea are in full swing."
在一项声明里，朝鲜质问这类对话的意义，“当在韩国进行的反对我们的军事演习正如火如荼地进行着的时候。”


"What is clear is that all of this has a purpose to destroy us." a speaks man said of the military drills, which started last week.
谈到这次上周就开始的军事演习，一位发言人这样说：“很明显，唯一的目的就是消灭我们。”



The north has expressed anger over the US-South Korea military drills, stating they violate the agreements reached with US president Donald Trump and Mr Jae-in.

In a recent letter to Mr Trump, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un is said to have complained "about this ridiculous and expensive" military exercises.
据说最近金正恩给Trump的一封信中，已经对这场“又荒谬又昂贵的”军事演习表达了抱怨。


The deadlock of denuclearisation talks is entirely the fault of South Korea's decision to hold the drills, then North's reunification spokesman said. 
无核化会谈的搁置，完全是韩国进行军事演习的错误决定造成的，朝鲜统一委员会的发言人如是说。

“We have no more words to talk with the South Korean officials.", the official said in a statement carried by the state-run Korea Central News Agency.

[BBC]China describes Hong Kong protests as 'near terrorism'


China has condemned violent clashes in the Hong Kong protests as " behaviour the is close to terrorism - in a sign of its rhetoric hardening.

中国谴责香港看一行动中的暴力冲突是“有恐怖主义倾向的行为”。以此标志着中国方面的态度越发强硬。


After days of peaceful protests at HK international airport, clashes with police broke out on Tuesday night.

香港国际机场的抗议游行在最初几天的平静之后，与警察的冲入终于在周二爆发了。

Video showed an officer drawing his gun on protests who beat him with his own truncheon during the disturbance.

从现场的视频可以看到，在混乱中，游行者抢了一名警察的警棍，并用这个警棍袭击他。这名警察掏出枪指着这些袭击他的示威者。

It is the second time in a week that China officials have publicly likened the protests to terrorist activity.
一周内，这时中国政府第二次公开将这次示威游行比作恐怖活动。

Some observers believe that the repeated use of such language suggests that China is losting patience with the protesters, and could increase the likelihood of an intervention  from Beijing.
一些观察员认为，中国政府重复使用这样的语言，表明他们正在对这些游行示威者失去耐心，北京会介入的可能性可能会增大。


The US said it was "deeply concerned by the reports of Chinese paramilitary movement along Hong Kong border" and urged China to respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy 
美国方面表示，他们“对中国在香港边界的准军事行动表示震惊”，并催促中国尊重香港的高度自治。

#
#Concerned with" means "relating to", "involved with": This report is concerned with #technical details. "concerned by" (or "concerned about") means "worried by", "troubled #by": I'm concerned by the increase in traffic accidents.


However, most analysts consider that at this stage, a direct military intervention is still unlikely. 
然而，大部分的分析家认为，目前来看，直接的军事介入并不太可能发生。


The former British colony has a special status, with its own legal system and judiciary, and rights and freedoms not seen in mainland China. However, many activities believe it is now under threat.
香港作为前英国殖民地，拥有独立的立法与司法系统，并有着中国大陆居民无法企及的自由和权利。然而，许多活动价们认为，这些特权正在经受着威胁。

Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in 10 weeks anti-government protests, demanding democratic reform, and an investigation into alleged police brutality.While many  of demonstrations were peaceful, an increasing number have ended in violent clashes with police.
数百万香港民众参加了持续十周的反政府抗议，要求民主改革，并对被他们描述成“残酷”的警察行为展开调查。在大部分的游行活动都很平静的进行过程中，越来越多的游行却开始演变成了与警察的冲突。


The last protest, an "occupation " of the airport, led to hundreds of flights being cancelled after protesters escalated their action, thought normal service has been resumed.
最近的一次抗议游行占领了机场，随着示威行动越演越烈，尽管基本服务已经恢复，但却导致了数百航班被迫取消。

But China seized on the brief outbreak of violence as evidence of "violent crimes" that " breached legal and moral bottom lines".
但是中国抓住周末爆发的短暂暴力冲突不放，说这是“暴力犯罪”，“已经违背了法律与道德底线”。

[BBC] Anti-natalists: The people who want you to stop having babies.
不想生孩子的人们


They believe humans shouldn't have children.who are the anti-natalists and how far are they willing to push their ideas?
他们认为人类不该生孩子。反生育者到底是何许人也？他们又是如何推广他们的观点的？


"Wouldn't it just be better to blow a hold in the side of the earth and just have done with everything?"
比起其他选项，直接从地球的一端凿个洞，从此地球和人类一起毁灭，是不是更好？
#note: "and just be done with everything, means and just finish (or end) everything" - By Ken



Thomas, 29, lives in the east of England, and although his idea of blowing up the world is something of a thought experiment,
 he is certain about one thing - humans should not have babies ,and our species should gradually go extinct. 
住在英格兰东部，29岁的托马斯，尽管他的“把地球凿一个洞”的想法仅能算做一项思想实验，另一件事他却十分确信：人类不应该繁衍后代，我们的种族应该逐渐灭绝。

It's a philosophy called anti-natalism. While the idea dates back to Ancient Greek, it has recently 
been given a huge boost by social media.

这个称为“反生育论”的观点，尽管可以追溯到古希腊时期，但最近却在社交网络上大面积火热起来。

On Facebook and Reddit, there are dozens of anti-natalist groups, some with thousands of members.On Reddit,
 r/antinatalism has nearly  35,000 members, while one of the dozens of Facebook groups with an anti-natalist theme 
has more than 6,000.

Facebook 和Reddit上，都有几十个反生育者小组，有些组员都有几千人。 Reddit上的r/antinatalism, 成员将尽3万5千人。Facebook上的仅仅一个组，
成员就超过了6千多人。
这样的组Facebook上有几十个。

They are scattered around the world and have a variety of reasons for theirs beliefs. Among them are concerns about 
genetic inheritance, not wanting children to suffer, the concept of consent, and worries about overpopulation and the 
environment.
这些小组在世界上传播开来，为他们的观点提供了众多的理由。比如，出于对基因遗传的考虑，不想孩子受苦，出生并没有得到孩子的许可，对人口过剩和环境资源的担心。


But they are united in their desire to stop human procreation. And although they are a fridge movement, some of their views,
 particularly on the state of the earth, are increasingly creeping into the mainstream discussion.

他们因为对人类停止繁殖后代的共同愿望而联合在一起。尽管只是边缘运动，其中的某些观点，尤其是与地球现状相关的观点，正不断渗透入主流价值观的讨论当中。

While not a anti-natalist, the Duke of Sussex recently said he and his wife were planning to have a maximum of two
 children, because of environmental concerns.

 Sussex 公爵尽管并不是反生育者，但近期他仍然说，出于对环境问题的考虑，他和妻子决定最多只要两个孩子。

Thomas hadn't heard of anti-natalism before someone used the term to describe his views in a Facebook comments thread 
A few years ago.Since then, he's become an active member of an anti-natalist Facebook group. It provides him with 
intellectual Stimulation and a place to test his debating skills.

 Thomas 在别人用反生育者在一个fackbook帖子里描述他之前，并没听说说这个词。从那以后，他就成了一个Facebook小组里的活跃成员。在那里，他可以被激处灵感，
也能锻炼辩论技巧。


=== Insults and criticism.
That doesn't mean that all anti-natalist hate children, according to whose who spoke to BBC.
并非所有都讨厌孩子。从接受BBC采访的人中可见一斑。

“I would say I personally like children and it's because I like them that I don't want them to suffer." Said Nancy. 
"Maybe bringing them into the world would give me some pleasure but the possible threat is so huge I'm just not sure 
it's worth it.

"我挺喜欢孩子，也正是因为我喜欢孩子，才不想要他们受苦。”。 Nancy这样说到。“把他们带到这个世界上也许会给我带来快乐，但他们会面对的潜在威胁太巨大了，
我不确定我那点快乐是不是值得冒这么大的风险。

In some　anti-natalism groups, users allude to the notion that babies shouldn't been born in war zones, if there is high 
Chance of disability, or even to low-income parents. At times the rhetoric sounds like selective bleeding-or eugenics.


在一些反生育组中，组员们暗示战乱地区的人不应该生孩子，如果孩子先天残疾的概率高，甚至父母的收入等情况，也不应该生孩子。有时，这听起来很像一种种族选择，择优出生。

The anti-natalists we spoke to had mixed feelings about those ideas.
我们采访的这些人中，对这些观点的感觉也各异。

"What are their motives behind having a baby?"says Thomas, when asked if he's concerned about children being born 
in war-torn Areas." In such a country there is less hope that things are going to turn around."

”在这些地区的人想生孩子的动机是什么呢？“当被问到他对战争区域出生的孩子的观点时，Thomas这样说到。”在这些地区，情况好转的希望很渺茫啊。“

He's more relaxed about children being born into low-income households.
出生在低收入家庭的孩子，他的态度会轻松得多。

"Obviously I am against having kids... but I think you can be happy and in a low-income area."
“很明显我反对生孩子，但我想及时生多在低收入区域，人仍然可以活得快乐。”


“My anti-natalism is across the board," states Nancy.She opposes eugenics. " why are we picking and choosing some 
groups because They are in a position of disadvantage?"

我的反生育理论并没有具体针对的群体。nancy说。 她不赞成种族选择。为什么我们要单独强调某些群体，仅仅因为他们处在不利的条件下呢？

“Do the best you can," says Kirk, "Be kind - and don't procreate."

 “做到极致，与人为善，并且，别把生命带到这个世界上。” Kirk　说。

I'm hoping we get back for them and we're not on a flight" she said
来自英国的HM要在周四回去查考试成绩。 她说：“我真希望???????'

But others were more understanding of the protests. " I was excepting something, given all the news", 
one arrival, Gurinda Singh, told Reuters news agency.

但其他乘客还是对抗议活动表示理解。到港乘客GS告诉路透社：“？？？？？？？？？”；

As rumours spread that police plan to move in on protests on Monday evening,  thousands opted to leave on foot.
 There are large backlogs for transport back into the center, local reports say.
据说警察会在周一傍晚介入，许多游行者因此选择步行离开机场。当地报道成，积压的人流给回城的交通带来巨大压力。

The BBC's Stephen McDonell, who is at the scene, says the airport has effectively shut down while authorities 
work out how to deal with the iris.
在现场的BBC记者 SM 说，机场服务关闭得很高效，机场人员也同在寻找对策化解危机。

Hongkong's mass demonstrations and unrest show no sign of abating, more than two months after they were sparked 
by a controversial extradition bill.

香港的这场大型示威骚乱，因为一项争议的印度法案引起，已经持续两个多月，仍没有减退的迹象。
