How do I take a screenshot on a Mac?
On a Mac, you can take a screenshot of the whole screen or a selected portion. The screenshot will be automatically saved to your desktop.

To take a screenshot of the entire screen, press Cmd+Shift+3 together.

To take a screenshot of a selected portion, press Cmd+Shift+4 together. Then, using your mouse, click at a corner of the area you want to screenshot, drag, and let go when you have covered the selected area.
