=======================

1: Guthub:https://github.com

 MCIN2018 : GitHub name 
 myl2012@hotmail.com/T12…..a

1.1. Create Github account and first repository hello-world

Under your account , find .ssh folder. ( on your computer. Not on Github)

To check if id_rsa and id_rsa.pub , if they don’t exist, to create them:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Add public to Github:setting->adding ssh key.  ( this is on Github)


====: to clone the remote repository hello-world. ( it is different with the below one.  The folder was not created on Github.  The below one, the folder was created on Github)

 Git clone git@github.com:MCIN2018/hello-world

===: create repository codes and connect it to local repository codes. 

git remote add origin git@github.com:MCIN2018/codes
   : ssh:git@github.com:MCIN2018/codes.git
     Https:https://github.com/MCIN2018/codes.git



=======
To add a new repositories : ( this is not a good example.  The folder on Github shouldn't be created manually )

1;To add a repository at Github: resource ( private)

2: TO Clone the remote repository resource to /users/mc/resource

  

Git clone git@github.com:MCIN2018/resource. : This will become /users/mc/resource/resource!!!!  Be careful, to make sure the structure of your folders. 


 After this operation, go to 3:

3: ( this doesn't need since the resource repository has been created on Gitghu)


git remote add origin git@github.com:MCIN2018/resource
